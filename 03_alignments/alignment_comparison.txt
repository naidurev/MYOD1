Multiple Sequence Alignment Comparison - MYOD1 Project
=======================================================

Two alignment methods were employed to ensure robust phylogenetic inference:

1. MAFFT (L-INS-i algorithm)
   Purpose: Domain conservation analysis, conserved motif identification
   Algorithm: Iterative refinement with local pairwise alignment
   Advantages: 
   - Superior handling of divergent sequences (fish-mammal comparison)
   - Cleaner alignment for visual interpretation
   - Better suited for large evolutionary distances
   - Optimized for domain identification
   
2. PRANK (Phylogeny-aware alignment)
   Purpose: Phylogenetic tree construction
   Algorithm: Explicit modeling of insertions vs deletions
   Advantages:
   - More biologically realistic gap placement
   - Reduces phylogenetic artifacts from indel misalignment
   - Better branch length estimation
   - Proper evolutionary modeling

Methodology Justification:
--------------------------
The dual-method approach allows us to:
- Use MAFFT for identifying conserved functional domains (clearer patterns)
- Use PRANK for accurate phylogenetic tree topology (evolutionary correctness)
- Compare results to validate robustness of findings
- Demonstrate methodological rigor

This approach is consistent with best practices in comparative genomics
where different MSA methods serve complementary analytical purposes.
