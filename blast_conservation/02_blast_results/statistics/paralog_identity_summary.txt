MRF Family Paralog Identity Summary
====================================

Average identity between human MYOD1 and other MRF members:

Reference: Human MYOD1 (ref|NP_002469.2|)

MYOD1 vs MYF5:  ~45.7% identity (estimated)
MYOD1 vs MYOG:  ~50.4% identity (estimated)
MYOD1 vs MYF6:  ~N/A% identity (estimated)

Interpretation:
- Identity >80%: Recent divergence (orthologs across species)
- Identity 40-70%: Ancient divergence (paralogs within genome)
- All MRF members share common ancestral gene
