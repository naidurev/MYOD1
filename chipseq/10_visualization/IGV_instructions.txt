How to Visualize MYOD1 ChIP-seq Data in IGV
============================================

1. Download and open IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer)
   https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download

2. Load mouse genome (mm10):
   Genomes → Load Genome from Server → Mouse mm10

3. Load your data files:
   File → Load from File → Select:
   - 05_alignment/SRR396786_sorted.bam (MYOD1 ChIP-seq)
   - 05_alignment/SRR398262_sorted.bam (Control)
   - 06_peaks/MYOD1_peaks_peaks.narrowPeak (Peak calls)
   - 10_visualization/top100_peaks.bed (Top peaks)

4. Navigate to interesting regions:
   - Search for muscle genes: Myod1, Myog, Actc1, Des
   - Or paste coordinates from top peaks

5. Visualization tips:
   - Right-click track → Set track height (50-100)
   - Right-click track → Autoscale
   - Use Zoom slider to see peak details
   - Compare MYOD1 vs Control tracks

Example coordinates to explore (top peaks):
$(head -10 10_visualization/top100_peaks.bed | awk '{printf "  %s:%d-%d\n", $1, $2, $3}')

Look for:
  ✓ Clear enrichment in MYOD1 vs Control
  ✓ Peaks near muscle gene promoters
  ✓ Conserved E-box motifs in peak sequences
